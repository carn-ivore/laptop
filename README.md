Tracks changes I've made to my laptop


2/8/2025
Downloaded ProtonVPN_v3.5.1_x64 from protonvpn.com
Installed Proton VPN; none of the other apps the installer had pre-checked.

I ran the VPN
Connected to a VPN
Opened an InPrivate window in Edge
Tried to go to deepseek.com
Doesn't support secure something
I tried it in a non InPrivate browser
Didn't work.
Is DeepSeek just unavailable outside of China?
